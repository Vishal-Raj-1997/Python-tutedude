#Assignment - 01......

......Task - 01.....

It asks the user to input the first number (a).

It asks the user to input the second number (b).

It calculates and displays the Addition of a and b.

It calculates and displays the Subtraction (first number minus second number).

It calculates and displays the Multiplication of a and b.

It calculates and displays the Division (first number divided by second number).
It works as a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers provided by the user.


......Task - 02........

It asks the user to enter their first name and stores it in first_name.

It asks the user to enter their last name and stores it in last_name.

It combines both names with a space in between to form the full name.

Finally, it prints a greeting message saying “Hello, [Full Name]! Welcome to the Python program.”
This program takes the user’s name and gives a personalized welcome message.


#######***Assignment - 02***######
.......Task - 01.......

It asks the user to enter a number and stores it in num.

Using the modulus operator %, it checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

Otherwise, the number is odd.

It displays the result accordingly (Even Number or Odd Number).
This program takes an integer input and tells whether it is an Even or Odd number.

........Task - 02...........

A variable sum is initialized with 0.

A for loop runs through all integers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

In each iteration, the current number i is added to sum.

After the loop ends, the program prints the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.

           ...........Task 01 ...........


"This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.
If the number is 1, it returns 1 (base case). Otherwise, it multiplies the number by the factorial of (n-1).
The program takes user input and prints the factorial of that number." That is factorial of 5 is 120

             
                ...........Task 02 ...........


This Python program demonstrates the use of the math module for mathematical calculations.

The program first asks the user to enter a number.

It then calculates:

The square root of the number using math.sqrt().

The natural logarithm (base e) of the number using math.log().

The sine value of the number (in radians) using math.sin().

Finally, it prints all the calculated results.
